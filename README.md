## Loading HTML fragments:
There are two way to load HTML fragments:
1. Compile them into html during build time
2. Fetch them and insert them during run-time

## When to use what
- Use compile time fragments only on parts which you want to ensure are seen by every user right after page load (e.g logo)
- Use run-time fragments for everything else so that the final HTML is of reasonable size (<1MB idealy)

## How to add a new fragment
- Add it to the `src/fragments` folder (e.g. `src/fragments/banner.html`)
- For run-time fragments, add {{{fragment-name}}} to appropriate place in `src/index.html` (e.g. {{{fragment-banner}}})
- For compile-time fragments, add <div id="fragment-name"></div> to `src/index.html` where you want to insert the fragment (e.g. <div id="fragment-banner"></div>)


## How to know which fragments are available
- Run `npm run dev` and look at the console for available fragments
